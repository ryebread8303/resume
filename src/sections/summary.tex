\header{Summary}
I am a workstation and system administrator with over 10 years of professional 
experience working with a wide variety of systems, both hardware and software. 
Starting out in help desk roles has prepared me for communicating with non 
technical end users and taught me the role of technical support in the business. 
Transitioning to onsite support brought me into contact with a broad range of 
hardware and gave me experience from the contractor's side of the IT support industry. 
Four years working for the US Army as a civilian has broadened my organization/teamwork 
experience, given me an opportunity to manage systems at a scale well beyond 
that found in a typical office, and required I come up with new solutions in 
keeping with numerous policies and regulations. I hope to continue on to a 
role where I can manage diverse systems and make greater use of the automation 
skills I've developed over the course of my career.
